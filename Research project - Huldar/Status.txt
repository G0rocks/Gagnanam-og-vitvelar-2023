Yesterday I did some work on the project. Finished generating some pseudo-data and started on the RBFNN module
RBFNN = Radial basis function neural network

I finished
bus stop classifier.py

But I need to fix up things in the RBFNN_HI.py file still.
Going to work on that today. Though I do understand the algorithm better now. Made the breakthrough in
understanding that the algorithm is about putting up clusters and the radial basis is just checking if the
data point is close to those cluster centers. Way simpler now in my mind at least.

I have read the paper about radial basis function neural networks and I have made a code that gives me data.
Note, the code does not use the data from strætó, I need more time to work out that data but the code generates
somewhat random data.

After talking with Jón I have shifted my mindset, I was really focused on doing step 1 first and then step 2,
where the steps are:
1. Make the data be in the way we need.
2. Create RBFNN
But Jón helped me realise to do focus on step 2 first and then on step 1 (if I have time)
