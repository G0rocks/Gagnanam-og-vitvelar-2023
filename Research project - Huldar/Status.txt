I have read the paper about radial basis function neural networks and I have made a code that gives me data.
Note, the code does not use the data from strætó, I need more time to work out that data but the code generates
somewhat random data.

After talking with Jón I have shifted my mindset, I was really focused on doing step 1 first and then step 2,
where the steps are:
1. Make the data be in the way we need.
2. Create RBFNN
But Jón helped me realise to do focus on step 2 first and then on step 1 (if I have time)
